          <h3> WHY OSF ?</h3>
          <p>
            The whole world is going online, and we are still sitting in the era
            of 1900â€™s where people use references to hire worker for their home.
            OSF is a web application that provides
            an easy way to find a service provider. It's a marketplace for
            service providers, and consumers. OSF creates the bridge between the worker and the finder.
